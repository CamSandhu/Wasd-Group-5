                            Because we have seen the big potential in this team, we decide that we must give them
                            a little impetus, so we start sponsoring this team with our healthy product. 
                            We know that our product will help them to keep up with all the long nights of 
                            training for the championship. After the first week of using our product, they were 
                            more than impressed by its effectiveness.

                            Martin Larsson, known as REKKLES(22 years old).
                            is a professional gamer from  Sweden. He’s playing for Fnatic, a well known team from
                            United Kingdom. He always wants to be focused on his game no matter what and to have the
                            best results. He’s also a very active person even if he’s sitting at least 8 hours per day.
                            He really enjoys going to the gym and running because he can’t handle the sedentariness of
                            his job. He doesn’t trust energy drinks or their alleged effect and he sometimes doesn’t
                            have time for making smoothies, so he’s looking for a better option, a quicker one regarding
                            how he’s going to stay hydrated and giving his body all needed vitamins and minerals during 
                            the gaming sessions or during a tournament.
